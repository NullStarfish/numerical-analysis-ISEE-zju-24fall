# if ${x_1, x_2, ..., x_k}$ is not independent

let p is the maximum number that {x1, x2, x3, ..., xp} are independent

There are $c_p$ are not all 0

$c_1x_1 + c_2x_2 + c_3x_3 + ... + c_px_p = x_{p+1}$

$c_1Ax_1 + c_2Ax_2 + ... + c_pAx_p = Ax_{p+1}$

$c_1\rho_1x_1 + c_2\rho_2x_2 + ... + c_p\rho_px_p = \rho_{p+1}x_{p+1}$

$c_1(\rho_{p+1} - \rho_1)x_1 + c_2(\rho_{p+1} - \rho_2)x_2 + ... + c_p(\rho_{p+1} - \rho_p)x_p = 0$

because x1, x2, ...xp is independent, so c1, c2, ... cp are all 0
which is contradictory
