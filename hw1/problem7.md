Since \( g \) is differentiable, its derivative is continuous.  
Given that \( |g'(p)| > 1 \), there exists a constant \( $\epsilon$ \) such that for \( p - $\epsilon$ < x < p + $\epsilon$ \), \( |g'(x)| > 1 \).  
According to the fixed-point theorem, in this interval, the fixed-point method diverges. Therefore, there exists a number less than \( $\epsilon$ \) that satisfies the conditions of the problem.
